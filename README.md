# Linen
Javascript library for HTML5 Canvas designed to simplify 2d drawing for common tasks.

## Background
The Linen library started out as a way to expedite printed and digital prototyping of card games. The name “Linen” comes from a printed asset finish called “linen” that is commonly used on playing cards.

## Development
Linen could use some help if it is to become usable in projects. Completed documentation including examples would be a good start. 

## Documentation
Currently there is only JSDoc inline with the source code. You can find a sample [here](https://jsfiddle.net/OntoDevelopment/656o6y8s/) on JSFiddle.
