# Linen.js
Linen.js is a Javascript library for the HTML5 Canvas API designed to simplify 2d drawing for common tasks.

## Background
The Linen library started out as a way to expedite printed and digital prototyping of card games. The name "Linen" comes from a printed asset finish called "linen" that is commonly used on playing cards.

## Development
Linen could use some help if it is to become usable in projects. Completed documentation including examples would be a good start. 

## Documentation
You can find further [documentation here](https://github.com/BrianWendt/Linen/wiki/Documentation) or inline JSDoc.
